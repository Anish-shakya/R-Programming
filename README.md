# R-Programming ðŸ˜€
R is an interpreted language; users can access it through a command-line interpreter. Suppose a user types 2+2 at the R command prompt and presses enter. In that case, the computer replies with 4 . R supports procedural programming with functions and, for some functions, object-oriented programming with generic functions.

# Data Structure in R
# 1) Vector in R:
A vector is a group of data elements of the same type, stored in a sequence in R. There are two types of vectors: atomic vectors and lists.
There are six primary types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, character (which contains strings), complex, and raw. 
The last twoâ€“complex and rawâ€“arenâ€™t as common in data analysis

# 2) List:
A list in R can contain many different data types inside it. A list is a collection of data that is ordered and changeable.
To create a list, we can use the list() function.
You can refer to the above list. r program to know about some methods that can be used along with a list.

# Pipe:
R pipes are a way to chain multiple operations together in a concise and expressive way. They are represented by the %>% operator, which takes the output of the expression on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right. Using pipes in R allows us to link a sequence of analysis steps.

# DataFrame:
Data frames are the most common way of storing and analyzing data in R, so itâ€™s essential to understand what they are and how to create them. A data frame is a collection of columnsâ€“similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Each column has a name at the top representing a variable and includes one observation per row. Data frames help summarize data and organize it into a format that is easy to read and use. 
Some important functions to remember:ðŸ‘‡
1) head() : Help to view the first 6 rows of data frame
2) str() : Helps to view the structure of data frame
3) colnames() : Helps to view the column names present in data frame
4) summary() : Helps to  summarize the data from a Data Frame
5) glimpse() : Used to see the columns of the dataset and display some portion of the data with respect to each attribute that can fit on a single line.
